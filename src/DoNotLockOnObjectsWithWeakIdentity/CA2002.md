# DoNotLockOnObjectsWithWeakIdentity

## [CA2002](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2002): Do not lock on objects with weak identity

An object is said to have a weak identity when it can be directly accessed across application domain boundaries. A thread that tries to acquire a lock on an object that has a weak identity can be blocked by a second thread in a different application domain that has a lock on the same object.
